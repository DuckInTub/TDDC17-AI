Loop:
Check all neighboring cells for unknown cells.
Move to unknown cells with bias order: left, forward, right.
In the case that there are no unknowns: backtrack until there is an unknown neighbor.
Keep checking unknown neighbors in the same bias pattern again.

This is a DFS with backtracking. Backtracking because the agent can not teleport.


NOTE: Currently backtracking uses a simple stack of move directions. 
Also, we have no real way of getting home at the end.

Revisit the idea of the HashMap. This can give us breadcrumbs to get back home.
