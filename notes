For each visited cell remember parent cell and direction used to enter.

Loop:
Check all neighboring cells for unknown cells.
Move to unknown cells with bias order: Forward, cell to the right.

In the case that there are no unknowns backtrack until there is an unknown neighbor.
Keep checking unknown neighbors in the same bias pattern again.
